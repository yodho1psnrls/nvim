To frequently update this repo, use:
1) git add .  (stage the commit stages to your local repo)
2) git commit -m "Describe your changes here" (Commit the changes)
3) git push (after commiting the changes locally, push them to the remote repo
(Optional - fetch and pull updates, if you updated it on another computer)
4) git fetch origin (fetch updates)
5) git pull origin main ( pull the updates)
6) git status (check repository status)

To properly set up the lsp for a cpp project, use a symlink:
mklink compile_commands.json Debug\compile_commands.json
(Assuming you are in the root directory)

If for some reason you dont want to use git: rm -rf .git

A very handy search tool for words in txt files: grep -r "floating" path/to/folder

If you want to automate some aspects of updating your configuration, consider:
Setting Up a Script: You can create a shell script to
 automate the git add, git commit, and git push steps.
Using Git Hooks: Git hooks can automate tasks at different stages of the
 Git workflow. For example, you could create a post-commit hook to run
 tests or validations on your configuration.

-------------------- OUTSIDE DEPENDANCIES -------------------------
CMake - install it from the official site
mingw from msys2, it includes gcc(c++ compiler), gdb(not it doesnt include gdb)(c++ debugger, mingw-w64-x86_64-gdb) (msys2's distribution has more features and tools than the official gnu one)
ccls from chocolatey (c++ lsp, 2022 precompiled ccls, else you would have yto build it yourself)
or instead of ccls, use clangd -- https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md#clangd
lua-language-server (lua lsp)
pylsp (python lsp, install it from pip)
debugpy(python debbuger, install it from pip)
(All of those thing should be set on PATH(Environmental Variables))
(Optional) Install GitHub CLI - to use github through the terminal
you already have a lot functionality with git alone, but with GitHubCLI
you can directly login and create or remove new repos from the terminal
